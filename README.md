Here we got a Neural Network with 3 layers each layers has 1 or more ``perceptrons``, the perceptrons from the input layer send the data to the hidden layer and finally to the output layer, is a ``feed-forward`` network, it goes from layer to layer until the end

### Arquitecture types
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: Is the first and simplest neural network created, the processed data goes only forward and not in cycle like the majority of neural networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Network or CNN**: Mostly applied in the image processing related field, the perceptrons are receptive because they work as biological human eyes.
- **Recurrent Neural Network or RNN**: It works like a cycle because the hidden layer has feedback, its used in the language field to create paragraphs or sentences with the context.
- **Radial basis function Neural Network or RBF**: It's like the ``feedforward`` neural network but in the hidden layer the output of the function is calculated depending on the distance the center is.
- **Modular Neural Network**: Like the name describes, there are isolated neural networks which compose the Modular neural network, namely, each isolated neural networks is a module.
